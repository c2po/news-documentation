Important changes
-----------------

Full support of FAL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The full range of FAL assets can now be used, e.g. videos from youtube and vimeo and every file type which is supported by the various file renderers of the core and 3rd party extensions.

Removal of old code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pre-FAL relations
"""""""""""""""""
Before FAL, EXT:news used to have custom relations to own media files and related files. Those 2 relations and all related code has been removed. This includes

- TCA
- Model
- Every migration and wizard
- Any media renderer which have been based the old relations

If you are using the FAL relations and the old ones togehter in one project, you need to migrate those records! There is **no** migration available or planned. Either write it on your own or get in contact with me (I can not do it for free!)

Wizards & Migrations
""""""""""""""""""""
Every previous available wizard and migration code has been removed. This includes:

- Migration from custom category records to sys_category
- Migration of the tt_content relation

ViewHelpers

The following ViewHelpers have been removed:

- ``<n:falMediaFactory />``
- ``<n:mediaFactory />``

The following deprecated ViewHelpers have been removed:

- ``<n:format:date />``
- ``<n:format:hsc />``: Use ``<f:format.htmlspecialchars />``
- ``<n:format:htmlentities />``: Use ``<f:format.htmlentitiesDecode />``
- ``<n:format:striptags />``: Use ``<f:format.striptags />``

Any usage will throw an exception:

ClassAliasMapping
"""""""""""""""""
The mapping from non-namespace classes to the namespace classes has been removed.

Repositioning of the tt_content relation
