Important changes
-----------------

Removal of old code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pre-FAL relations
"""""""""""""""""
Before FAL, EXT:news used to have custom relations to own media files and related files. Those 2 relations and all related code has been removed. This includes

- TCA
- Model
- Every migration and wizard
- Any media renderer which have been based the old relations

If you are using the FAL relations and the old ones togehter in one project, you need to migrate those records! There is **no** migration available or planned. Either write it on your own or get in contact with me (I can not do it for free!)

Wizards & Migrations

Every previous available wizard and migration code has been removed. This includes:

- Migration from custom category records to sys_category
- Migration of the tt_content relation

ClassAliasMapping
"""""""""""""""""
The mapping from non-namespace classes to the namespace classes has been removed.

Repositioning of the tt_content relation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The relation to content elements has been moved to a separate tab.
